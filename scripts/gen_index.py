"""Generate result/INDEX.md: a table of contents over the per-revision pages.

Each result page is one `(suite, hardware profile, measured revision)`. The
index has two tables: the at-a-glance state of every cell, and the full list of
published pages keyed by revision and hardware.

The failure this exists to prevent: with one tracked report per
`(profile, suite)`, a cell that has not been re-measured keeps its old file, and
a reader -- human or agent -- sees a commit hash and a table without being able
to tell whether that cell reflects the current library or something weeks old.
Reports were self-describing; the *set* of them was not, so staleness leaked
into prose. Here it is structural and machine-checkable:

  status      meaning
  ----------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  missing     no run recorded for this cell
  current     measured at the reference revision, or at a descendant
  N behind    N commits touching the suite's `invalidated_by` paths lie between
              the measured revision and pins/tlinalg-rs.rev
  stale       as `behind`, but N exceeds the suite's `stale_after`
  dirty       the measured checkout had uncommitted changes; never comparable
  diverged    the measured revision is not an ancestor of the reference

`behind` counts invalidating commits, not raw distance: a suite that only
touches `crates/` is not out of date because a doc changed.
